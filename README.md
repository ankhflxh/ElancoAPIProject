# ElancoAPIProject
Project Overview
This project is a web application designed to retrieve and display country and population data using a REST API. The application allows users to visualize population data for various countries, making it easy to understand how many people live in each country. This project aligns with Elancoâ€™s goal of leveraging software-defined solutions and third-party APIs to create robust and user-friendly applications.

Features
Dynamic API Integration: Fetches data from multiple REST API endpoints for countries, capitals, flags, and population details.
Real-time Search Functionality: Users can search for specific countries, and the app dynamically updates the results.
Responsive Frontend: Designed with HTML and styled using CSS to provide a clean and user-friendly interface.
Asynchronous Data Handling: Utilizes JavaScript's fetch API with async/await for efficient and smooth data retrieval.
Error Handling: Gracefully manages failed API requests with user-friendly feedback.
